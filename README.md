A beginner-friendly machine learning project.

This is a basic implementation of a house price prediction model, perfect for learning the fundamentals of regression in machine learning.

This project is designed to predict house prices based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset containing relevant attributes of houses and their corresponding prices. 

Key Features:
Data preprocessing & feature engineering

Regression model training

Performance evaluation (MSE: 1.52)

Visualization of results

_Note: This is a simplified demo project - real-world applications would require more complex feature engineering and data processing._
